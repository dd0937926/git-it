<h2>Man Who Never Shuts Up About His Podcast Now Trapped In Elevator With Podcast Guest</h2>
            <p>
                Local man and aspiring podcaster, Chad, 32, received an ironic twist of fate today when the elevator he was in stopped between floors, trapping him with his scheduled podcast guest, renowned historian Dr. Eleanor Vance. Sources confirm Chad immediately suggested they use the time for an "exclusive, spontaneous interview," but Dr. Vance politely declined, opting instead to stare blankly at the emergency button. Chad then began to detail his elaborate, unrequested plans for the new season's intro music. The event marks the first time anyone has been truly forced to listen to Chad's ideas for more than five minutes, proving that sometimes, karma operates on a vertical axis.
