<h2>OTC Campuses now have classroom bunnies</h2>


<p>



    Ever wanted a little more comfort while sitting in class? OTC will now offer a cuddly companion while you attend
    class. Each class will be assigned 6 bunnies and a caretaker which will be a student intern assigned to the
    position. If you are interested in caring for the new fluffy friends please email the campus at
    bunnieinterns@otc.school or call 417-417-0000. This addition is expected to happen in the beginning of the Spring
    2026 semester. The bunnies are being donated from a local farm that has bred and raised these bunnies for 15 years.
    The bunnies are going to be a range of colors but all the cutest they can be. So far students have all praised the
    change and everyone is excepting this change to be a positive impact on student behaviors and moods in the
    classroom.
