<h2>Second Grade Teacher Outraged by Class Reaction to "Chocolate Ice Cream" Emoji</h2> 
       <p>Giggles and chaos overtook the classroom when the happy dessert lit up the screen last Wednesday. Second grade teacher Gully Bullguy lashed out on Facebook over the "inappropriate minds" of the next generation; students who allegedly mistook the softserve ice cream presented as some sort of "excrement." The rant has since gone viral, and perhaps not the way Bullguy had hoped.  As laugh reacts light up the notifications, we ask our readers: have you ever used the poop emoji in a different context? Let us know!</p>
